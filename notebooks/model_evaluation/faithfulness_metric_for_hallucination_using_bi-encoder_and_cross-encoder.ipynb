        "1. MULTI-SIGNAL APPROACH\n",
        "   • Semantic similarity alone is not enough\n",
        "   • NLI (entailment) provides the strongest signal\n",
        "   • Token overlap serves as a useful baseline\n",
        "   • Combined scoring improves robustness\n",
        "\n",
        "2. CLEAR SEPARATION\n",
        "   • Faithful answers typically score > 0.60\n",
        "   • Hallucinations typically score < 0.40\n",
        "   • The gap provides reliable detection\n",
        "\n",
        "3. TYPES OF HALLUCINATIONS DETECTED:\n",
        "   • Factual errors (wrong dates, numbers, names)\n",
        "   • Contradictions (opposite of what context says)\n",
        "   • Fabrications (invented information not in context)\n",
        "   • Misattributions (assigning actions to wrong entities)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. RECOMMENDED THRESHOLDS:\n",
        "   • >= 0.60: Safe to use (faithful)\n",
        "   • 0.40-0.60: Needs human review\n",
        "   • < 0.40: Flag as potential hallucination\n",
        "   • < 0.20: Block from production\n",

        "   • Set up alerts for low-scoring responses\n",
        "   • Use in RAG evaluation pipelines\n",
