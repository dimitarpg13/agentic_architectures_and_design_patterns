        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use MLflow faithfulness metrics to detect **extrapolation** in LLM outputs. Extrapolation occurs when the model goes beyond the information provided in the context, making inferences, generalizations, or predictions that aren't directly supported.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is Extrapolation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Extrapolation is when an LLM:\n",
        "- **Makes predictions** beyond what the data supports (e.g., \"This trend will continue...\")\n",
        "- **Generalizes** from specific examples (e.g., \"All X are Y\" from one instance)\n",
        "- **Infers causation** from correlation (e.g., \"A causes B\" when only association is mentioned)\n",
        "- **Adds unsupported conclusions** (e.g., \"Therefore, this means...\")\n",
        "- **Speculates** about intentions or future outcomes\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Extrapolation Matters:\n",
        "| Impact | Example |\n",
        "|--------|---------|\n",
        "| **Overconfidence** | User trusts speculation as fact |\n",
        "| **Poor Decisions** | Acting on unsupported predictions |\n",
        "| **Liability** | Legal/medical advice beyond evidence |\n",
        "| **Misinformation** | Presenting inference as established fact |\n",
        "\n",
        "### Faithfulness Score for Extrapolation:\n",
        "| Score Range | Interpretation | Risk Level |\n",
        "|-------------|----------------|------------|\n",
        "| >= 0.75 | Grounded Response | Safe |\n",
