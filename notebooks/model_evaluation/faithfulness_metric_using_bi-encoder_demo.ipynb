        "## What is Faithfulness?\n",
        "\n",
        "Faithfulness measures whether a generated response is grounded in the provided context, without introducing hallucinations or fabricated information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Approaches in this Notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Keyword-Based Faithfulness**: Measures overlap between context and response keywords\n",
        "2. **NLI-Based Faithfulness**: Uses Natural Language Inference to check entailment\n",
        "3. **Semantic Similarity Faithfulness**: Uses sentence embeddings to measure semantic alignment\n",
        "4. **Claim Decomposition Faithfulness**: Breaks response into claims and verifies each\n",
        "\n",
        "### Faithfulness Score Range:\n",
        "- 0.0 to 1.0 (or scaled to 1-5)\n",
        "- Higher scores indicate better grounding in context\n",
        "- A score of 1.0 means fully faithful with no hallucinations\n"

        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Multiple Methods Are Better**:\n",
        "   - Keyword-based: Fast, interpretable, but surface-level\n",
        "   - NLI-based: Captures semantic entailment, detects contradictions\n",
        "   - Semantic similarity: Good for overall alignment, may miss subtle issues\n",
        "   - **Ensemble**: Combines strengths, most robust\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **When to Use Each Method**:\n",
        "   - **Keyword**: Quick sanity check, identifying obvious hallucinations\n",
        "   - **NLI**: Detecting contradictions, factual inconsistencies\n",
        "   - **Semantic**: Overall coherence, topic alignment\n",
        "   - **Ensemble**: Production systems, comprehensive evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Limitations**:\n",
        "   - Keyword-based misses paraphrases\n",
        "   - NLI may struggle with long contexts (need chunking)\n",
        "   - Semantic similarity can be fooled by topically similar but factually incorrect content\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Production Considerations**:\n",
        "   - Cache embeddings for repeated evaluations\n",
        "   - Consider batching for throughput\n",
        "   - Set thresholds based on your risk tolerance\n",
        "   - Log scores for monitoring and improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "### Score Interpretation:\n",
        "- **0.7-1.0**: High faithfulness, safe to use\n",
        "- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate faithfulness, review recommended\n",
        "- **0.3-0.5**: Low faithfulness, verification required\n",
        "- **0.0-0.3**: Likely hallucinated, do not use\n"
