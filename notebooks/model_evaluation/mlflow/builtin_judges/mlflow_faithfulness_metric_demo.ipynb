        "\n",
        "- **Factual Consistency**: Measures if claims in the output can be verified from the context\n",
        "- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies fabricated information not present in the source\n",
        "- **LLM-as-Judge**: Uses a language model to assess faithfulness\n",
        "- **RAG-Focused**: Essential for retrieval-augmented generation systems\n",

        "### Faithfulness Score Range:\n",
        "- Typically 1-5 or binary (faithful/unfaithful)\n",
        "- Higher scores indicate better alignment with source context\n",
        "- A score of 5 means fully faithful with no hallucinations\n",
        "- A score of 1 indicates significant deviation from source material\n"
