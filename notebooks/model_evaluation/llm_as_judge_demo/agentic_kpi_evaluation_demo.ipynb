    "This notebook demonstrated a comprehensive embedding-based KPI evaluation system for agentic workflows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminates LLM-as-Judge dependency**: Uses deterministic embedding comparisons\n",
    "2. **Provides fast evaluation**: 10-100x faster than LLM-based scoring\n",
    "3. **Supports multiple metrics**: Accuracy, faithfulness, relevance, consistency, coverage, specificity\n",
    "4. **Enables production deployment**: With caching, batch processing, and parallel evaluation\n",
    "5. **Offers comprehensive analysis**: Statistical summaries, correlations, outlier detection\n",
    "6. **Reduces costs**: No API calls for scoring, works offline\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is production-ready and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for continuous agent evaluation."
